# Data-Analysis-Project-on-the-Discovery-of-Handwash-
A Data Analysis and Data visualisation project done on the case study of the Discovery of Handwash by Dr.Ignaz Semmelweis.

In this project I took up a case study done on the effects of Handwashing in the 1840's by Dr.Ignaz Semmelweis and upgraded it by showing the visualisation of the raw data which this case study consisted  of.  

What did I learn from this project? 
 I brushed up my skills by doing:
  - Data Analysis using pandas.
  - Data visualization using matplotlib.
